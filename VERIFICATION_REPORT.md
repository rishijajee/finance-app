## Testing Notes

### Why Node.js Tests Fail
Yahoo Finance API returns 401 errors when called directly from Node.js scripts, even with proper headers. This is a known limitation where Yahoo Finance blocks programmatic access from servers.

### Why Browser Tests Work
The same API calls work perfectly in browsers because:
- Browsers send additional headers automatically (cookies, etc.)
- Yahoo Finance allows browser access for their website
- CORS is not an issue within browsers

### Testing Recommendation
**All testing must be done through the browser interface:**
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Test home page with stock lookups
4. Test Options > Top Call Options page
5. Verify all filters, strategies, and real-time data

See `TESTING.md` for detailed browser testing instructions.
