# Market Hours Feature

## Overview

The app now includes intelligent market hours detection that automatically informs users about data freshness based on US stock market hours.

## How It Works

### Market Hours Detection

The app checks the current time in **Eastern Time (ET)** and determines market status:

**Market Open:**
- Monday - Friday
- 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
- Status: Green indicator with "Market Open"
- Message: "Displaying real-time prices"

**Market Closed - After Hours:**
- Monday - Friday after 4:00 PM ET
- Status: Red indicator with "Market Closed (After-Hours)"
- Message: "Showing latest closing prices from today's trading session"

**Market Closed - Pre-Market:**
- Monday - Friday before 9:30 AM ET
- Status: Red indicator with "Market Closed (Pre-Market)"
- Message: "Showing latest closing prices from previous trading session"

**Market Closed - Weekend:**
- Saturday and Sunday
- Status: Red indicator with "Market Closed (Weekend)"
- Message: "Showing latest available prices from last trading session"

## Visual Indicators

### Status Banner

A prominent banner appears in the header showing:

**When Market is Open (Green):**

## Data Freshness Rules

### During Market Hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET):
‚úÖ **Real-time data**
- Stock prices update with every refresh
- Options prices reflect current market
- All data is live and current

### After Market Hours (After 4:00 PM ET):
‚è±Ô∏è **Latest closing prices**
- Stock prices show closing values from today
- Options prices show last traded values
- Data is from the most recent trading session
- Still accurate for analysis and planning

### Pre-Market (Before 9:30 AM ET):
‚è±Ô∏è **Previous session closing prices**
- Stock prices show yesterday's closing values
- Options prices show previous session's last values
- Data is from the most recent completed session

### Weekends:
‚è±Ô∏è **Last trading day's prices**
- Stock prices show Friday's closing values
- Options prices show Friday's last values
- Data is from the most recent trading session

## Why This Matters

### Transparency
Users know exactly what they're looking at - whether it's live data or closing prices.

### Trust
Clear communication about data freshness builds confidence in recommendations.

### Planning
Even after hours, users can analyze positions using the latest available prices.

### Accuracy
The app always shows the most recent data available from Yahoo Finance, whether the market is open or not.

## Implementation Details

### Timezone Handling
```javascript
// All times converted to ET
const et = new Date(now.toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: 'America/New_York' }));
```

### Market Hours Check
```javascript
// Market hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
const marketOpen = 9 * 60 + 30;  // 9:30 AM
const marketClose = 16 * 60;      // 4:00 PM
```

### Weekend Detection
```javascript
const day = et.getDay();
if (day === 0 || day === 6) {
  // Weekend - market closed
}
```
