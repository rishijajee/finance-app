# Data Time Rule: 3:55 PM Closing Period

## Overview

The app now clearly displays that after-hours data comes from the **3:55-4:00 PM ET final trading period** when the market is closed.

---

## The Rule

### When Used After Market Hours (After 4:00 PM ET):

**Data Source:** Closing prices from 3:55-4:00 PM ET

**Why 3:55 PM?**
- This is the final 5-minute trading period before market close
- Captures the closing auction and final trades
- Most accurate representation of the day's closing values
- Yahoo Finance API returns closing prices from this period
