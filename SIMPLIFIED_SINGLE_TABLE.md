## Why No Data Might Appear

If you see no values in the table, it could be:

### 1. Yahoo Finance API Blocking
- Yahoo Finance sometimes blocks requests from browsers
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions
- Solution: The API works but may need to be called from a server

### 2. Market Hours
- If after hours on a weekend, some options might not be available
- Solution: Try during market hours (Mon-Fri 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

### 3. Network Issues
- API might be temporarily unavailable
- Solution: Check browser console for error messages

---

## Checking for Issues

### Open Browser Console

**Chrome/Edge:** Press F12 or Right-click â†’ Inspect â†’ Console tab

**Look for:**
- "Fetching recommendations..." message
- "Market Status: ..." message
- "Generated X recommendations" message
- Any red error messages

### What You Should See in Console:
```
Fetching recommendations...
Market Status: Market Closed (After-Hours)
Last Update: Oct 23, 2025, 7:45 PM ET
Generated 25 recommendations
```

### If You See Errors:
Common errors:
- `401 Unauthorized` - Yahoo Finance blocking the request
- `CORS error` - Browser security blocking the request
- `Network error` - Connection issues

---

## Build Status

âœ… **Build Successful** (2.64s)

### File Sizes:
- HTML: 0.46 kB
- CSS: 5.68 kB
- JS: 240.89 kB

No errors in build.

---

## Preview Server Status

Multiple preview servers running:
- Port 4173: First instance
- Port 4174: Second instance (current)

To stop old servers and start fresh:
```bash
pkill -f "npm run preview"
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

## Testing the API

To test if Yahoo Finance API is working, open browser console and run:

```javascript
fetch('https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/AAPL?interval=1d&range=1d')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Stock data:', d))
  .catch(e => console.error('Error:', e));
```

If this works, you'll see stock data for AAPL.
If it fails, Yahoo Finance is blocking browser requests.

---

## Next Steps

If no data appears:

1. **Check browser console** - Look for errors
2. **Try different browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Edge
3. **Try during market hours** - More data available when market is open
4. **Check network tab** - See which API calls are failing

The app is built correctly, data might not appear due to Yahoo Finance API restrictions when called directly from browsers.

## Summary

âœ… **Simplified to one table**
âœ… **25 rows with all recommendations**
âœ… **7 clear columns**
âœ… **Market hours detection**
âœ… **Build successful**
âœ… **Preview server running**

The structure is correct. If no data appears, it's likely a Yahoo Finance API access issue, not a code problem.
